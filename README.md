# rnn
Code base to learn rnn

I will be adding the rnn practice code developed from scratch to understand the working of RNN. This is the perfect way to learn it.

# Pipeline of work
- use tensorflow to speedup the training
- validation split and use to check the progress of the training
- implement CWRNN
- start implementing the new idea for embedding
